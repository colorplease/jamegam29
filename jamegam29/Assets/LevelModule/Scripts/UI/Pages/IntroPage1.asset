  pageText: "A young boy named Jack had grown a beanstalk a few months ago and gained
    access to a giant\u2019s castle in the sky. He took advantage of the giant\u2019s
    wife\u2019s kindness in order to steal treasures from the giant, and help his
    widow mother. Jack was caught by the giant one day, and forced to cut down the
    beanstalk while being chased, killing the giant. "
